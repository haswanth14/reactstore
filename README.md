Here I am creating E-commerce platform using MERN (MongoDN, Express, React, Node.js) stack


In the backend, I've successfully established a robust User Management system employing the MERN stack- MongoDB for database management, 
Express for server-side operations, Mongoose for streamlined database modeling, and Node.js for server runtime.

The core functionalities encompass comprehensive CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations integrated with secure user authentication and authorization. 
This ensures that only authorized individuals have access to this platform, preserving the integrity of E-commerce services.

To strengthen user data protection, I've implemented bcrypt.js for secure password hashing. This encryption method adds an extra layer of security, prioritizing user confidentiality and system integrity.


In the frontend, I'm currently in the process of development. The goal is to create an visually appealing user interface using React and React Redux. The focus here is on improving the overall user experience in order to create a user-friendly platform.


Upon completion of this project,, we will be able to see good shopping experience with dynamic product listings, secure user authentication and a lightning- fast search engine.
The platform will seamlessly connect globally, encompassing integrations with payment gateways like PayPal, order processing and efficient international shipping logistics.
Users can able to get personalized recommendations, advanced filtering and interative shopping carts that can be customized to their needs.
 Additionally, an admin dashboard will be created for comprehensive oversight and control over the platform's operations.
